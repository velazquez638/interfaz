# interfaz

In this proyect we have implemented our code with javaFX.

I have used the scene builder programa to create the pages and the code was created whith javaFX.

At firts we showed the principal pane whith the login section.

# login section
                                                                                          # login code to show the pane

                                                                                         ![](pictures/Captura5.PNG)
